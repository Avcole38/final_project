#Overview: Medical Insurance Cost Analysis
#This project analyzes factors that influence medical insurance costs using data from Kaggle.
#In this analysis I will look at factors such as smoking status and region to decern medical 
#insurance cost billed to the individual.I will attempt to find any trends leading to higher medical care costs
# To sync packages and reproduce the working environment, make sure you install R and then install renv by running 'install.packages("renv")' in the console

# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis:This is the area to describe the details of my final project and the findings 

# Overview:This project analyzes factors that influence medical insurance costs using data from Kaggle.

# Contents of report: In this analysis I will look at factors such as smoking status and region to decern medical insurance cost billed to the individual.I will attempt to find any trends leading to higher medical care costs.

# How to generate final report: Run the R Markdown file `FinalProj_R_markdown-1.Rmd' to produce the HTML or PDF report. Next click the 'Knit' button in RStudio to render the report to HTML

# Code for creating table: The code generating Table 1 is located in the `Table 1` section of `report/FinalProj_R_markdown-1.Rmd`. It uses `dplyr` and `gt` to summarize charges and BMI by smoker status.  

# Code for graph 1 and 2: Graph 1 entitled medical charges based on BMI will be found in the `Graph 1 : Medical Charges vs. BMI` section in `FinalProj_R_markdown-1.Rmd'. Graph 2 entitled 'Medical Charges Based on Smoking Habits' will be found in the 'Graph 2: Smoking Habits vs. Charges` section in `FinalProj_R_markdown-1.Rmd`. Knitting the R Markdown file will generate both the table and figures automatically in the final HTML report.
